for some reason he's a few years younger than me and Trey

and he goes what should I do with my career you guys
然后说：“你们觉得我以后往哪方面发展好？”

and we were like what do you want to do

you know something about Mormons like a musical about Mormons

yeah what?

it was like the only other person in the world

you know it's pretty cool yeah 
这很酷

when someone gets the joke
当别人 get 了我们的梗

When the great part too is that we're actually getting some Mormons coming 
第二幕真有一些摩门教徒来看了

and we can tell because we there's a part of the show that really only a Mormon would get
我们可以说这是唯一一幕摩门教徒能看懂的
 
whatever 
无论如何

and so we're always back there at the back of the house while the show's going on 
演出过程中我们每次回到后场

and you'll hear them 
然后就听到他们说

well there's a part where we quote Abinadi
有个片段里我们引用了 Abinadi 作为角色

and you hear them, the Mormons, going “that was Abinadi”
然后就听到他们摩门教徒说“那个就是 Abinadi ”

There are a lot of Mormons over there
那边在笑的肯定都是摩门教徒

A Mormon prophet Abinadi, and we quoted him, that's how obscure it is
Abinadi 是一个摩门教先知，我们把他写在我们的剧里，很多人都看不懂

but are they reacting good as well as the Mormons?
那其他人能有摩门教徒们一样好的观影体验吗

yeah, it's a pretty select group of Mormons that will actually even come to the show 
来观看演出的摩门教徒是一个非常有限的数字

but of those, they seem to really like it 
但是，他们都表现得很喜欢

why Mormon? are you just obsessed with Mormons?
为什么选择摩门教呢？你就这么痴迷摩门教吗？

they're just awesome
他们太绝了

we grew up in Colorado so we're kind of from Mormon country
我们在科罗拉多长大，可以说我们就是来自一个摩门国家的

you know we knew Mormons growing up 
我们看着摩门教发展起来

and Mormons and musicals seemed like about an inch away from each other 
而且摩门教和音乐剧有着非常密切的关系

yeah that's kind of seem like they're about to burst into song you know
他们（摩门教徒）对待音乐狂热痴迷

because I grew up really loving the classics, like Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals
我从小就很爱经典音乐，比如罗杰斯和汉默斯坦的音乐剧

and I always loved how happy and optimistic they were
我也很欣赏他们的乐观和对音乐的享受

and I was like oh nobody's like that anymore, except for Mormons
我觉得没人会这样喜欢他们了，除了摩门教徒们

this is kinda awesome
妙极

so then you did it and then, did you preview it somewhere?
你制作完成以后，有在什么地方预演一下吗？

where did you ... I guess here in New York?
你在哪里？我猜会在纽约？

we did workshops for like five years
我们做了五年的研讨

how come you are not going with puppets but humans in this one?
为啥这次没有用木偶反而开始用真人了？

that's a good question. why didn't we use puppet?
这是个好问题，我们为啥不用木偶了？

I guess because they suck
因为木偶太烂了

Team America almost killed us we swore we will never work with puppets again  
《Team America》差点要了我们小命，然后我们发誓再也不做木偶戏了

the way a musical is, the way, this whole process 
做音乐剧的方式，它的整个过程

is it's a lot different from what we're normally used to 
和我们以前做的东西完全不同

which is us two sitting in a room, with computers and cutouts of Cartman and doing that 
以前我们只用坐在房间里，用电脑和 Cartman 的剪纸形象操作

this is, you really, we're working with like a great cast of consummate artists 
但这次我们要真正地和一批杰出的艺术家打交道

and when you're writing for the stage you kind of need your writing for certain people
当你为舞台创作的时候你也需要为每个特定的人去创作

like Josh Gad and Andrew Rannells, who played the two missionaries  
比如出演两位传教士的 Josh Gad 和 Andrew Rannells

they've become really the part of the writing process, you need that 
他们组成了我们重要的创作过程

it is very different than us two locked in a room together in LA and doing this by ourselves 
这和在洛杉矶时我俩锁在房间里独自创作非常不同

you actually have to get feedback and change something or chop it
我们可以获得他们的反馈，修改或者剪掉一些部分

we work with human beings
我们在和人类一起工作

yeah, with actual human being instead of paper
是的，和人类工作而不是剪纸

yeah absolutely I guess so 
当然我也这么想

and you have the soundtrack and all this stuff as well 
然后你就把那些电影声带什么的也都弄好了吗

we're actually recording the soundtrack this week
其实我们这周正在录制声带

are you finding there's a bunch of rules? 
做这些会有很多规矩吗？

will Broadway not let you say what you want to say? are there censors?
百老汇有没有不让你畅所欲言？有审查人员吗？

no that's what's crazy is for the first time we don't have any of that
没有，这简直了，我们头一回没有遇到任何审查

because I'm on Comedy Central even we have you know, there's standards and practices 
因为在喜剧中心电视台创作的时候我们要遵循很多标准和惯例

and with a movie you've got the MPAA
在制作电影的时候也要遵循MPAA的规定

and with this, for the first time, we've just got a theater
但这次是我们头一回只得到一个剧院

and we can pretty much do what we want 
我们可以很大程度的想做什么就做什么

it's a train I rented a theater and putting on a show
？流程就是，我租了个剧场，然后上演一部剧

that's so cool
太酷了

I guess we could do something hardcore enough to get the police after 
我都觉得我们可以整点硬核的，能把条子都弄来那种

I don't think oh 
我不这么认为

in Spider Man they're killing people every night and they're not shutting it down 
《蜘蛛侠》里面不也每晚都杀人嘛，也没人喊他们停播

so I can't wait to see this out 
所以我已经等不及想看这个演出了

when we come back around we talk a little bit about South Park okay
等我们回来我们谈点关于《南方公园》的话题

The Book of Mormon! we will be back!
《摩门之书》！我们稍后回来！
[Applause]

[Music]

Hey everybody we are back with Matt Stone and Trey Parker

and the new Broadway musical is The Book of Mormon

and it's the hottest ticket around right now in New York City

if you come down here check it out go to restaurant road through the theater district 

yeah it's a pretty great doing theater

yeah it really is

I mean how long we've been here now in New York 

it's so awesome to be in the same room as people laughing at the stuff 

yeah it's true 

cuz we're just so used to, like, we get the stuff done 

and then we're just go to bed

you view it on the internet next day and it goes "oh that's funny"

it's instant gratification

you also know what jokes don't work

yeah right, then we cut them

it's terrifying to be in the same room with a thousand people

as you put on some of the stuff that's in The Book of Mormon, the first time 

yeah

you just like, "oh god! here goes! oh god! here goes!"

like "this is gonna tank", but it doesn't

yeah, normally, we have stuff tanked all the time and we just don't know

because we're at home and you're watching it at your home 

yeah and there's no live chat in South Park

it's a, it's been it's been terrifying, but it's been pretty cool too

I'm so excited I'm so

I cannot wait to see this is like the thing I'm really looking forward to seeing 

and South Park is 15 seasons ?

15 years

15 years! oh my gosh

and that's what you got guys got discovered

yeah, I mean, he was, yes, he did, he sent out a bunch of tapes 

we did a tape for a friend of ours named Brian Graydon who's a television executive

just to send out as a Christmas card 

and he sent out like 40 of them, and I think one was probably to George Clooney 

and this was back when you have like it was a VCR tape

yeah VHS tape

VHS tape that mean pre DVDs even 

and people had to copy it tape to tape to send it around

I think I've seen that one

is it Jesus versus Santa Claus?

yeah it was the spirit of Christmas

but in the space of that time, people were like

"oh I saw this really funny thing here! you got to check it out! you got to check it out!"

and then they copy it on it on another VHS 

？？？

we sound so old it's unbelievable like you know when we started people had tapes 

but now you have South Park studios dot-com 

which is all the shows you can watch all of the stuff over there
